        <h2>
        Yet another plan emerges for 2020 MLB season start: teams train at home
      </h2>
      <p>
        We have another trial balloon to examine regarding the potential launch
        of a 2020 MLB season, this one with teams skipping Arizona and Florida
        and training out of their home ballparks before a limited season
        begins—but many details still need to be addressed before baseball
        returns.

      <h2>MLB season startup: Here are the pros and cons of the three most likely scenarios
    </h2>
      <p>As government officials evaluate the medical and societal impacts of reopening parts of the country amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Major League Baseball must decide whether bringing its sport back and televising it to home-bound fans is a worthwhile risk.

      <h2>Will MLB really start July 1? The 'Plouffe plan' is out there</h2>
      <p>In rounding up all the various iterations of restart plans and rumors for Major League Baseball last week, I never once considered what can now only be termed “The Trevor Plouffe” plan.

      <h2>MLB players 'want to play,' no plans set in stone, union chief says
    </h2>
      <p>“As players, we want to play. As these ideas find their way into mainstream media, there are some ideas that seem to make sense, there are others that don't track very well. All of them are being viewed against the backdrop of getting back on the field and affording our guys an opportunity to do what they love to do," Clark said.

      <h2>The MLB connection to the KBO League</h2>
      <p>The KBO League, South Korea’s highest professional baseball league, will begin its regular season in about nine hours from the time of this posting. ESPN will broadcast the games “generally on ESPN2 and the ESPN App.”
